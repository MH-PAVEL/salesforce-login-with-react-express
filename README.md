# salesforce-login-with-react-express

#### have a .env file in salesforce-api folder like,
````

PORT=8080
loginUrl='https://login.salesforce.com'
sandboxUrl='https://test.salesforce.com'
callbackUrl='http://localhost:8080/auth/callback'
consumerKey='clientID'
consumerSecret='secretKey'
apiVersion='53.0'


````

that would be it, run yarn commands on both and yarn run start to run the projects! thats it!!!
